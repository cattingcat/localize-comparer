          "content": "<p>CompanyAccount is provided to you by AO Kaspersky Lab, located at bldg. 3, 39A, Leningradskoe Shosse, Moscow, 125212 and will be \n\nreferred to in this document as \"we\" or \"Kaspersky Lab\".</p><p>We occasionally update our privacy policy without advance notice, \n\nso we recommend that you periodically check for changes.  Updates to our privacy policy will be published in this section.  Please \n\nalso see our privacy policy regarding basic data (<a href=\"http://www.kaspersky.com/privacy\"target=\"_blank\n\n\">http://www.kaspersky.com/privacy</a>).</p><p>We are always happy to clarify::</p><ul><li>what personal data we collect, store, \n\ntrack, or use</li><li>who is authorized to request your personal information</li><li>how you can correct inaccuracies found in this \n\ninformation</li></ul><p>By personal data or personal information we mean information that may be used separately or in combination \n\nwith other information to identify, contact, or locate a particular individual, or identify someone in context.</p><p>You can contact \n\nus directly at the email addresses indicated at the bottom of this page.</p><h4>Information we collect and store</h4><p>Kaspersky Lab \n\nrespects your desire to protect your personal data.  This page describes the information we may request from you as you use \n\nCompanyAccount and the situations where we may request it .</p><p>You can decide whether to continue actions that require personal \n\ninformation provision. However, please note that if you do not want to provide the required information, you will not be able to \n\nperform the associated operation.</p><h6>Account registration</h6><p>To use CompanyAccount and access all of its features, you must \n\ncreate:<ul><li>a personal account</li><li>an account for your company, unless your coworkers have done this previously</li></ul>This \n\nwill require that you provide your corporate email address (which will be your username), password, first and last name, company name \n\nand country, and your company's license to use Kaspersky Lab applications. We will process and use this information solely for the \n\npurpose of providing you with CompanyAccount services and technical support, unless you explicitly choose to have it processed and \n\nused for other purposes. After registration your personal account will be linked to your company's account. </p><p>If your company's \n\naccount was previously created, then your registration information (first and last name and corporate email address) will be sent to \n\nthe CompanyAccount Administrator from your company. The company employee who first registers the company and a personal account is \n\ntypically designated as the Administrator.</p><h6>Account settings</h6><p>You can at any time view, update, correct your account \n\ninformation and password, or delete your account on the \"My account\" tab.   After your account is deleted, your data will be stored \n\nby Kaspersky Lab in order to improve customer service, but your ability to access CompanyAccount using that account will be \n\nblocked.</p><p>Your company's CompanyAccount Administrator will also be able to change your account settings and reset your \n\npassword.</p><p>If you are your company's CompanyAccount Administrator, then you have the ability to edit personal accounts for all of \n\nyour colleagues and block the entire company's account (employees' personal accounts will remain in the \n\nsystem).</p><h6>Licenses</h6><p>You can add and view your company's licenses to Kaspersky Lab products on the \"Licenses\" tab of your \n\nCompanyAccount (activation codes or key files for each product).  The license provided during registration will be added automatically \n\nto your company's CompanyAccount. </p><p>Key files are not physically stored on CompanyAccount. The system only stores a record about \n\nyour company's license.</p><p>Every company employee with a personal account linked to your company's CompanyAccount has access to the \n\nlist of licenses.</p><p>Your CompanyAccount Administrator can remove your company's licenses by deleting them from the \n\nlist.</p><h6>Contracts</h6><p>If your company purchases additional customer support services, then after the purchase has been \n\nrecorded you will be able to view the list of purchases services on the \"Contracts\" tab.</p><p>The list of contracts will be \n\navailable to those company employees who were designated as authorized to use the paid service at the time of purchase.  These people \n\nwill automatically receive notifications about the expiration of the contract.</p><h6>Customer support requests</h6><p>If you contact \n\nCustomer Support or the Anti-Virus Lab team for support through CompanyAccount, we may ask you to submit information we may require \n\nfor providing assistance to you.  For example, this may include information about the product associated with your request, computer \n\nhardware, your company's network, software, and the nature of the problem you've encountered.  Moreover, it may be helpful or even \n\nnecessary for you to send us the files you are having trouble with or files that define the configuration of your computer or network. \n\n You can do this by using the \"Attach files\" option in the request form. These files may contain user-specific or otherwise \n\npersonally-identifiable file names, metadata, or content.  It is always your choice whether to upload these files.   If you would like \n\nto upload files, please first view and accept our <a href=\"http://support.kaspersky.com/support/rdp\" target=\"_blank\"> Regulation \n\non data provisioning</a> on the file upload page. </p><p>In order to choose the correct customer support department for your request, \n\nwe will use information about your company's licenses, country, and possibly the interface language selected in your \n\nCompanyAccount.</p><p> Your colleagues may have access to your requests if your CompanyAccount Administrator manually changes the \n\ncorresponding settings (the Administrator can view requests automatically). Access to requests is not limited in time, but the files \n\nyou upload may be deleted six months after your request is closed.</p><h4>Security measures we employ</h4><p>We use standard \n\nadministrative, physical, and electronic measures to protect received personal information from unauthorized access.  We encrypt all \n\npersonal data transfers using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology and store this information only in secure data centers with \n\nrestricted access.</p><h4>To whom we can submit personal information</h4><p>Your data or your company's data is used solely to provide \n\nyou with the requested service, unless you have given your consent to receive marketing materials or participate in annual user \n\nsurveys.
